/**
 * Phase 8, §3 — reassigning a trip's vehicle/driver used to overwrite
 * the existing `Allocation` record in place (same `id`, fields
 * mutated). That's fine today only because the two callers
 * (`RequisitionsPage.tsx`'s pre-approval "Change Vehicle", and
 * `ConflictsPage.tsx`'s conflict-resolution reassign) both act before a
 * confirmation slip, duty slip, or mileage entry could exist for that
 * trip — nothing historical is actually at stake yet. But FRD §25 wants
 * reassignments to create a new record referencing the old one rather
 * than mutate in place, and the in-place version would become a real
 * problem the moment a future feature reassigns an *already-approved*
 * trip (FRD §21 describes exactly that). Callers should
 * `removeAllocation(existing.id)` then `addAllocation(...)` the result
 * of this, rather than calling `updateAllocation` on the same id.
